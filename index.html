                    <h3>What’s wrong with Government today?</h3>

                    <p>Australian politics is broken. Traditional politicians say one thing to get elected and then do another.
                      Horse trading and back room deals have become more important than good policy, and the will of the people.
                      Powerful lobby groups, and international corporations wield enormous political power, while ordinary
                      Australians have little meaningful say in their country. </p>

                    <p>Our parliament is based on the exclusivity of a nineteenth century power structure that doesn't work for
                      the information age. When it comes to the challenges of a modern world, it's just not up to the task. As
                      more information is produced every day than one could read in a lifetime, the demands for governmental
                      specialisation and decentralisation have never been higher. Using some clever technology, Flux will put
                      political power into the hands of those best suited to use it.</p>

                    <p>
                        New policy platforms are not enough to fix this mess. “Business as usual” just won't do. Flux is here
                        to redistribute political power, empower the Australian people through real political participation,
                        and enable specialists to help repair bad policy. Flux will give Australia the framework it needs to meet
                        the challenges of the 21st century head on.

                    <h3>What is Flux?</h3>

                    <p>Flux is a gateway Australians can use, to participate directly in parliament, making the need for trust
                      in elected officials a thing of the past. Elected Flux MP’s and Senators give up their autonomy and use
                      their votes in line with the outcomes produced by the Flux ecosystem; an ecosystem comprised of ordinary
                      Aussies like you.</p>

                    <p>
                      When Flux is implemented, it will take the form of an app you can access right from your computer or
                      smartphone. You’ll be given a vote on every bill put before Federal Parliament, and can use that vote
                      immediately on the issue at hand, give it to a trusted third party to cast on your behalf, or save it
                      for an issue you care more passionately about later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Flux as a party is a vehicle for driving this systemic political change, with no policy platform beyond
                      parliamentary reform. Flux as a system, is a tool for changing how policy is shaped. It will allow more
                      voices to join the conversation, empower specialists to become politically involved in their fields, and grant
                      Australians direct access to producing better policy for a better Australia.

                      <p><b>Don't feel like scrutinising every bill before parliament?</b> We thought you might say that.</p>

                      <p>We understand your life gets busy. Between work, family and trying to enjoy a social life, it can be hard
                         to get your head around the entire business of government. With Flux, this doesn't mean you have to miss out.</p>

                      <p>There are two other options. You can:</p>

                      <p><b>Give your votes to someone else.</b> Each of us has a special set of skills, talents and passions. For
                        governance, this means that some of us are best suited to making decisions on specific things, which is
                        why Flux allows participants the option to pass their voting power to someone they trust, whom they feel
                        is better able to cast their vote. This could be a friend, a community organisation, an activist or even
                        one of the established political parties. This is what we call democracy - the choice is <i>yours.</i>
                      </p>

                      <p>If you change your mind about who you've given your vote to, you're free to take it back at any time.
                        Until now, giving your vote to a traditional politician at the ballot box means they can walk away with it,
                        and betray the values on which they were elected. When that happens, you've wasted that vote, and there's
                        not a lot you can do about it.</p>

                      <p><b>Accumulate political capital.</b>
                          Because each of us is unique, we all value different aspects of public life differently.
                          Flux recognises this by allowing participants to trade away their votes on issues they don’t value,
                          and save the political capital for those they do! Cast your votes for the issues most important to
                          you and your community.

                      <p>
                        We are Australians with a drive to improve democracy. We believe that our structure for decision
                         making and leadership are outdated, and that with the technology we have available, we can do
                         better. (See below for leadership)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Flux is a movement not about ideology, but about progress for process. Flux Party members come
                         from every age bracket and all walks of life, as well as from the left, centre, and right of politics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We’re for uniting all of Australia for a simple cause; better democracy for a brighter future.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If you're like us and want to see this country work toward a truly brighter future, join us.

                      makes Flux so great;</p>

                    <h6>Empower Specialists</h6>
                    Good policy is informed by policy expertise. Flux will enable specialists and experts, with the support of the Australian people, to meaningfully impact policy in their fields, in a way they never have before.

                    <h6>Built In Progress Through Trade</h6>
                    Growing trade in resources is one of the main drivers of growing prosperity. Flux brings this logic to the political arena, by encouraging participants to focus on the areas of politics they're most passionate about.

                    Our voting system isn’t run from a central server at party HQ. It is distributed across a public network, much like how Bitcoin works. This is a public ledger where anyone can verify that every vote is above board.

                    By distributing power away from brokers, middle men and party rooms, Flux makes backroom deals difficult and ineffective. Instead of convincing political operatives, lobbyists will have to convince us, the Australian people.

                    Flux encourages a culture of criticism. Voters examine new policy before it's enacted. Our process
                     demands that policy options can withstand rigorous criticism from many perspectives in society.

                    Canberra insiders, they'll have to persuade ordinary people, the way it <i>should</i> be.

                    Flux encourages Australians to bring their great ideas for their communities to the political arena.

            <h1>FAQ</h1>
            <h3>Is membership free?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. Membership is free forever. We don't believe charging a membership fee is necessary, and are working on other
                methods of funding to ensure we can provide open access to democracy to as many people as possible.
            </p>
            <h3>Does Flux have a platform?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes and no. We do have a platform of parliamentary reform, and we deliberately do not have any other platforms.
                We only seek to change the way decisions are made, not to actually make the decisions ourselves.
                The vision of Flux is not to be the source of new policy.
                The vision is to help the best policy be written.

            </p>
            <h3>Are membership details confidential?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes. Membership details will be exclusively used for party business, and never sold or willfully disclosed.
                Currently only Nathan and Max have access, though this will expand slightly as Flux proceeds through the registration process.
            </p>

            <h3>Why do I need Flux; I already have a representative?</h3>
            <p>
                While some representatives are good, none are good enough to represent everyone in their electorate.
                Too often people's concerns are ignored because their representative has different views to them.
                Flux believes nobody should be cut off from democracy just because they disagree with their representative.
            </p>

            <h3>Can I still sign up if I'm a member of another political party?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! The AEC is specific in their criterion for registration: "at least 500 members who are on the Commonwealth electoral roll and who are not also relied upon by another party for registration purposes."
            </p>
            <p>
                This means you're able to support Flux as a founding member if you're a member of any other party with a parliamentarian (so Labor, Liberal, Nationals, Greens, etc are all okay). The only time it is an issue is if you are a member of a party who does not have a parliamentarian, and are used by that party to support their registration.
            </p>

            <h3 id="faq-members">How many members are required for registration?</h3>
            <p>
                We can submit anywhere from 500 to 550 members to the AEC for registration.
                However, the counter (currently reading {{flux.members}}) does not reflect how many members have valid details <a href="https://oevf.aec.gov.au/">according to the AEC</a>.
                Often people forget important details like middle names, or suburbs and postcodes on their address.
                This means we actually need more than 550 submissions of interest.
                Please keep telling your friends about Flux even if our membership counter exceeds 550, as every new member increases the chance of successful registration.
            </p>

            <h3>Where do you provide attribution for creative common licensed works?</h3>
            <p>Here: <a href="https://voteflux.org/attribution">voteflux.org/attribution</a></p>

            <h3>Is your voting system the same as direct democracy?</h3>
            <p>No. Although there are similarities, they are philosophically very different. The main practical differences are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Swapping votes is allowed</li>
                    <li>Sending votes is allowed</li>
                    <li>Saving 'political capital' over time is allowed</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                Some similarities are: conservation of votes and distributing uniformly over the population.
            </p>

            <h3>How are candidates selected?</h3>
            <p>Please see: <a href="https://github.com/voteflux/voteflux.github.io/blob/master/posts/candidate-selection.md">https://github.com/voteflux/voteflux.github.io/blob/master/posts/candidate-selection.md</a></p>

            <h3>Where is the Flux constitution?</h3>
            <p>Here: <a href="https://github.com/XertroV/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md">https://github.com/XertroV/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md</a></p>

            <h3>When was party registration finalized?</h3>
            <p>March 29th 2016; an extremely quick application time of 2 months and 2 days.</p>

            <h3>How can I revoke my membership?</h3>
            <p>There is a button on your user details page in red at the bottom. All you need to do is click that. You were emailed a link to your user details when you joined, from the Flux Membership Robot.</p>

                        planning to use Liquid Democracy as it has a lower utility than a more liquid tokenized form of 'vote'.
                        Particularly, a transferable token allows for a greater degree of reorganization, in addition
                        to allowing voters to 'save' their tokens over time. This is important because it allows
                        a community to focus on big projects and develop a long term, stable, political strategy.
